BBAPI Programmer’s Manual

BBAPI allows client applications to access all sorts of data about BuzzerBeater teams wrapped inside formally defined XML containers by issuing a sequence of HTTP GET requests.
Basics

The workflow of an application accessing data via BBAPI is as follows:

    The client program hits login.aspx, passing the login name and the password of the user.
    The server sets an authentication cookie, which must be sent with all the following requests (your HTTP client library will usually take care of this part).
    The client program hits various pages and retrieves the data.
    The client program hits logout.aspx in order to end the session.

The rest of this document will walk you through the various pages. You can ask for clarifications in the BB App Developers forum. The staff will try to answer to BBAPI-related questions as quick as possible; keep in mind, though, that we cannot guarantee we’ll answer programming questions that do not concern BBAPI (we might be busy fixing the site, implementing some new feature or, well, we might not know your language of choice :).
Pages

The rest of this document will walk you through the various pages. You can ask for clarifications in the BB App Developers forum.
Generics
Errors

Errors result in pages having the following structure:


            <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
            <bbapi version='1'>
                <error message='ErrorType'/>
            </bbapi>
        

There are two error types that can be returned by every page:

    ServerError: something unexpected happened on the server side (the database is down, the server is too busy, or the BBAPI pages didn’t handle correctly some error condition). If the error persists, you can contact us in the BB App Developers forum.
    NotAuthorized: either you did not authenticate using login.aspx, or provided a wrong login name/security code combination, or your session expired. You should re-authenticate.

Dates

Dates are in the ISO standard format for dates, and refer to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) (not to the server time). The format is yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ssZ (e.g. 2008-06-22T13:12:49Z (T is a separator, Z means that the timestamp refers to UTC).
Schema

The format of the XML documents returned by BBAPI is described in a RelaxNG schema. The schema is meant to be self-documenting — BuzzerBeater users with a couple of months of in-game experience should be able to recognize the semantics of all the attributes and elements. If clarifications are needed, you can ask for them on the BB App Developers forum.

If a document returned by BBAPI does not validate against the schema, it must be considered a serious bug which will be addressed as soon as possible. Backwards compatible changes to the schema (e.g. adding new pages) are possible, and will be announced in the BB App Developers forum.
Base URL

All the BBAPI pages live in the directory http://bbapi.buzzerbeater.com/; for instance, in order to login you should send an HTTP GET request for http://bbapi.buzzerbeater.com/login.aspx?login=yourUserName&code=yourSecurityCode
login.aspx

Must be visited at the beginning of each session.
Parameters

    login: The login name — remember to URL-encode it properly!
    code: The read-only password.
    secondteam: If set to 1, will allow access to second team. Does not work with quickinfo.
    quickinfo: If set to 1, returns the contents of this users' TeamInfo page and does not set the authentication cookie (i.e. you can't access other BBAPI pages). Useful if you just want to authenticate against the BB users database without the need to access more data. Defaults to 0.
